## Welcome to the home of the Pressbooks Open Source project

Pressbooks is a book content management system that allows users to publish books to the public web and produce exports in multiple formats, including EPUB, PDF, and various XML flavours. The system is built on top of [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) Multisite but makes significant changes to the admin interface, web presentation layer and export routines of a standard WordPress installation. 

Pressbooks is used by educational institutions, academic presses, small publishers, as well as individual authors. For more documentation, see https://pressbooks.org/

## Support Pressbooks

Pressbooks is free software, released under the GPL v3.0 license. While Pressbooks is free & open source,, creating, improving, and maintaining this project takes time, effort, and money. As a result, we ask our open source users, who depend on the long-term sustainability of the software, to contribute to the project in various ways. Our favourite kinds of support are:
* financial contributions
* code contributions and testing
* helping other open source users [on our community forum](https://pressbooks.community).

If you are an institution using Pressbooks and would like to help sustain Pressbooks financially, please consider [hiring us to host your institution's Pressbooks network](https://pressbooks.com/for-educational-institutions/).
