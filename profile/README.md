We are a small company based in Montr√©al, Canada. We make open source book publishing software and provide SaaS hosting services so that individuals and institutions can quickly and easily share their ideas. Our core product is a book content management system that allows users to publish books to the public web and produce exports in multiple formats, including EPUB, PDF, and various XML flavours. The system is built on top of [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) Multisite but makes significant changes to the admin interface, web presentation layer and export routines of a standard WordPress installation. Pressbooks is used by educational institutions, academic presses, small publishers, as well as individual authors. The [Pressbooks Directory](https://pressbooks.directory) contains links to thousands of free books published using Pressbooks, most of which are openly licensed and educational in nature. For more documentation, see https://pressbooks.org/

## Support Pressbooks

While Pressbooks is free & open source, creating, improving, and maintaining this project takes time, effort, and money. As a result, we invite our open source users to help ensure the long-term sustainability of this project. Our favourite kinds of support are:
* financial contributions
* code contributions and testing
* helping other open source users [on our community forum](https://pressbooks.community).

If you are an institution using Pressbooks and would like to help sustain Pressbooks financially, please consider [hiring us to host your institution's Pressbooks network](https://pressbooks.com/for-educational-institutions/).
